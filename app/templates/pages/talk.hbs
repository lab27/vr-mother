		<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
		<p class="talk-description">We hosted our first Q&amp;A, titled 'Love, Loss, Lust' at Topics bookshop, Berlin.

Casey Spooner of FISHCERSPOONER discussed the development of the duo's new imagery, music and performance in light of the publication of 'Egos, an "aggressively homosexual" book that "attacks desire" and explores "the balance between connection and disconnection in a contemporary homosexual landscape".

FISCHERSPOONER is a multifaceted art and performance project helmed by Warren Fischer and Casey Spooner that produces music, dance, fashion, film and photography. The duo has released three full-length albums, #1 (2001), Odyssey (2005) and Entertainment (2009).

FISCHERSPOONER's hyper-stylised performances at clubs like WMF in Berlin and Pyramid Club in New York left packed houses awestruck when the began in the early 2000s. Intense press attention led to a record deal with club pioneers Ministry of Sound, which drove their first single 'Emerge' into the UK Top 40, leading to a legendary appearance on Top of the Pops, and in turn landed them a worldwide exclusive with Capitol Records.

World tours laters, this year marks FISCHERSPOONER's return to the studio, developing new music as a reaction to the imagery produced in their book 'Egos'.</p>
